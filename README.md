# 1ValetProject

 have completed all parts of the problem. The description is as below from folder structure point of view :-
1) Devices folder - It contains the front end part. Need to go to this folder in shell and run the command "ng serve --" which will open a browser with url as "http://localhost:4200"
2) DevicesWebApp folder - It contains the backend part.Open this project in Visual Studio and run it with F5 to host this service on "http://localhost:54119"
3) Part2_Answers word document : It answers the 2nd part of your project exercise.
4) DevicesDB.bak : Its a database backup created for this project.

I have also created a mock data which is commented in backend in case if you are not connecting to Database.

I have added a basic authentication which will require a
username and password within the header of http client request

The project is completely functional and compiling.
